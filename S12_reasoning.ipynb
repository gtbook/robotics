    "Reasoning involves manipulating data and models, ultimately reaching conclusions. This can take the form of perception, in which sensor data and models are used to make inferences about the state of the world or the robot; planning, in which action models and the perceived state are used to infer a plan that can transform the state of the world or the robot from its current state to a desired state; and, learning, in which data and models are used to improve the robot’s performance over time. In this book, reasoning ranges from very simple mathematical manipulations of probabilities to learning millions of parameters for a deep neural network."

    "Path planning deals with the problem of moving the robot from one position to another.  Avoiding collisions with obstacles in the environment (including humans and other robots) is generally a central concern for path planners.\n",
    "\n",
    "An easy way to address this problem is to discretize the world into a grid and then label grid cells as either being free or as containing an obstacle. The path planning problem is then to find a sequence of free grid cells such that the initial robot position is contained in the starting cell and the goal position is contained in the final cell. The disadvantage to this approach is that the representation of free space is conservative.  If a cell is partially blocked by an obstacle, then the entire cell will be treated as an obstacle and therefore be unavailable to the robot; there may be cases for which a collision-free path exists in the world, but not in the grid. In such cases, the robot will be unable to find a free path, even though it exists.\n",

    "For many tasks, grid-based approximations are not sufficiently accurate. Furthermore, the size of the required grid grows exponentially with the number of degrees of freedom for the system.\n",

If we decide to consider also the orientation of the robot, also using $100$ discretization levels, the grid grows to $100 \\times 100 \\times 100$.  If we consider a drone and represent its 3D position and 3D orientation, the grid grows to $100^6$, a very large data structure, for a fairly coarse quantization of the drone’s configuration space.\n",

Unfortunately, even the fastest of these algorithms has computational complexity that increases exponentially with the number of degrees of freedom of the robot (in addition to being extremely difficult to implement). For this reason, much research in path planning has focused on computationally efficient algorithms that perform well in practice, even though deterministic performance guarantees are not available.  Randomized, *sampling-based algorithms* are the most popular of these, and we will see some of these in Chapter 5, to plan paths for our DDR."

For completeness, we also introduce a control scheme that can execute the final trajectory on an actual drone."
