    "\n",
    "As described in Chapter 1, the representation of a robot's state should include all information that is necessary for the robot to act effectively in its environment to achieve its goals.  For a vacuum cleaning robot, this might include the exact location of the robot (e.g., x-y coordinates in a map of the house),\n",
    "the heading direction of the robot,\n",
    "whether the floor is carpeted,\n",
    "or the location of any pets or children that might be moving throughout the house.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we will abstract away many of these details by making the following\n",
    "assumptions:\n",
    "- The robot can move in any direction, which means that its heading angle is not important.\n",
    "- The robot is equipped with low-level navigation software that will allow it to move from one room to another, through doorways, etc. (though not with 100% reliability).\n",
    "- The robot is equipped with path planning software to clean the floor in a particular room (e.g., execute random\n",
    "motions, or follow a boustrophedon path).\n",
    "- The robot is equipped with collision-avoidance software, so that it need not worry about the presence of obstacles (e.g., furniture, small dogs, or children).\n",

    "<!-- The concept of state is an abstraction, allowing robots to reason about what is happening to them and their environment as they act. This does not necessarily mean that we, as robot programmers, have no deeper knowledge of what is going on: we do know that a vacuuming robot operates in a two dimensional space, typically a single floor in a domestic residence. However, we might have programmed in \"actions\" that abstract to the notion of moving from room to room, and hence may only be interested in knowing which room the robot is in for the purposes of triggering those actions. Other actions that are useful but will not discuss further in this section might involve vacuuming the current room, terminating when it is done or when the robot is stuck. Rather, we will concentrate below on navigation actions, moving from room to room, knowing that it might be only a small part of the repertoire that a true vacuuming robot needs to be useful. -->"

    "For the trash sorting robot, the state was defined as the category of the current item in the work space.\n",
    "This category had no dependence on the category of the previous piece of trash, nor did it have any effect on the category\n",
    "of the subsequent piece of trash. There were no constraints on the transition from the state at time $t$\n",
    "to the state at time $t+1$.\n",

    "if the robot is currently in the office, it cannot transition directly to the living room;\n",
    "it must first transition to the hallway before it can transition to the living room.\n",
    "For the vacuum cleaning robot, room adjacency is an important relationship, and therefore\n",
    "it should be encoded into our representation.\n",
    "This can be accomplished using a connectivity graph.\n",
    "Each vertex of this graph represents a state (i.e., a specific room in the house), and two\n",
    "vertices, $x_i, x_j$ are connected by an edge if and only if it the transition between\n",
