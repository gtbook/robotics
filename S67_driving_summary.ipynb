    "In Chapter 5, we introduced a configuration space that included both position and orientation information for\n",
    "a mobile robot moving in the plane. \n",
    "We did this by simply extending our coordinate representation of configuration from\n",
    "$q = (x,y)$ for robots that translate in the plane, to $q = (x,y,\\theta)$, where $\\theta$ denotes\n",
    "the robot's orientation.\n",
    "In a brief aside, we showed how to compute the position of any point on the robot, given its\n",
    "configuration. This computation essentially relied on basic trigonometry, and it was not immediately\n",
    "obvious how we might generalize our computations to robots that move freely in 3D.\n",
    "In this chapter, we solved this representation problem by \n",
    "introducing the special special orthogonal group,  $SO(2)$, to represent\n",
    "rotations, and the special Euclidean group, $SE(2)$ to represent combined translation and rotation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The matrices in $SO(2)$ are called *rotation matrices* and they have several notable properties: \n",
    "* $R$ is orthogonal (i.e., its columns are mutually orthogonal unit vectors)\n",

    "* $\\det R = +1$.\n",

    "The matrices in $SE(2)$ are called *homogeneous transformation matrices*, and they include\n",
    "rotation information (encoded by a rotation matrix as the upper left submatrix), and translation\n",
    "information (encoded by the rightmost column).\n",

    "\n",
    "Homogeneous transformation matrices can be used to compute coordinate transformations\n",
    "between various coordinate systems.\n",
