    "**Stochastic gradient descent** or **SGD** is an approximate gradient descent procedure, to cope with the very large data sets typically thrown at supervised problems. It is typically impossible to calculate the *exact* gradient, which requires looping over all the examples, which can run in the millions. An easy approximation scheme is to *randomly sample* a small subset of the examples, and calculate the gradient of the weights using only those examples. The upside is that this is much faster, but the downside is that this is only approximate. Hence, if we adjust weights with this approximate gradient, we might or might not make progress on the task. This procedure is called stochastic gradient descent, and it works amazingly well in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `DataLoader` class in PyTorch makes implementing SGD very easy: it can wrap any `Dataset` instance, and then retrieves training samples one \"mini-batch\" at a time. The code below uses a mini-batch size of 25, but feel free to experiment with different values for both this parameter and the learning rate to get a feel for what happens. Note that by convention we refer to one execution of the inner loop below, over a mini-batch, as an \"iteration\". One full cycle through the dataset by randomly selecting mini-batches is referred to as an \"epoch\"."

The answer is because with 250 training samples and mini-batches of size 25, each epoch adjusts the model's parameters 10 times. This effectively boosts the learning rate by a factor of 10. However, note that because each mini-batch looks at only one 10th of the dataset, each mini-batch's adjustment could *adversely* affect the performance on the other training samples."

    "We would be remiss in not mentioning the increasing importance of **transformer** architectures in computer vision and robotics. A transformer network can be viewed as deep multi-layer neural network whose connections can be rewired during training, through a process called **attention**. This architecture has led to the breakthrough of **large language models** or **LLMs**, which take a large context of *tokens* and produce a *next-token probability distribution* , which is then sampled to output a response to an input prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{index} pair: vision transformer; VIT\n",
    "```\n",
    "In computer vision, **vision transformers** or **VITs** use this same architecture, by *tokenizing* an image and provide it as part of the context. This allows LLM-style models to then answer questions about images, or perform traditional computer vision tasks such as object detection, image segmentation, and much more.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{index} pair: vision-language-action model; VLA\n",
    "```\n",
    "One step beyond VITs are **vision-language-action** models, specifically crafted for use in robots. They take not only visual input alongside language prompts, but also other signals such as joint angles (in case of articulated robotics), orientation sensors, etc... And, more importantly, they are trained to also output *actions* via specialized output heads, matched to the particular robot architecture that is targeted.\n",
    "\n",
    "A drawback of transformer-based methods is that they take a large aount of time and effort to train, and running the models on embedded computers is also a challenge. Hence, convolutional architectures remain competetive in robotics, especially when computational resources are constrained and/or there are constraints on communication that prevent calling a remote API. However, this is an intense area of study and the mix between fully connected, convolutional, and transformer architectures is sure to shift.\n",
    "\n",
    "While we do not discuss transformer architectures in detail here, some pointers into the literature are provided in section 5.7."
