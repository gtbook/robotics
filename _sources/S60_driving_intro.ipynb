    "In this chapter we look at some of the basic concepts involved in autonomous driving. Needless to say, the topic of autonomous vehicles is rather large, and we only cover a small selection in this chapter. \n",

    "We start out by becoming a bit more serious about movement in the plane, first introducing the matrix group SO(2) to represent rotation in the plane, and then extending this to the matrix group SE(2), which can be used to represent both rotation and translation in the plane. Both SO(2) and SE(2) are examples of Lie groups, which we introduce at the end of Section 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Section 2 we introduce kinematics in the form of Ackermann steering. In terms of sensing, besides cameras, a very popular sensor in autonomous driving is the LIDAR sensor. We look at its basic geometry, and then cover iterative closest points (ICP) as a way to obtain relative pose measurements from successive LIDAR scans in Section 3. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Section 4, we introduce simultaneous localization and mapping or SLAM, a very popular topic in robotics. Here we cover the most basic version, \"Pose SLAM,\" which only needs relative pose measurements. \n",
    "\n",
    "In section 5 we look at motion primitives to do some motion planning on the road. Finally, in section 6, we discuss the basics of deep reinforcement learning."
