    "## Models\n",
    "\n",
    "The key modeling tool that we introduced is the language of Bayesian networks. Bayes nets are a type of graphical model named after reverend Bayes, who also gave his name to the practice of interpreting probability distributions as *beliefs* rather than observed frequencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "A foundational Bayes net family is the Markov chain, modeling a state evolving over time. State transitions are modeled using a conditional distribution of the current state, conditioned on the previous state, invoking the Markov property. A Markov chain is then a sequence of such transition conditionals, and this in itself is an incredibly powerful idea. Typically, these transitions are *stationary*, in that they do not depend on time, but we have introduced *controlled* Markov chains to capture the dependence of the state on actions. This is an essential tool in robotics: modeling how the state of the robot and/or its environment changes -probabilistically- as a result of the robot's actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unrolling a Bayes net fragment over time was then generalized to the concept of Dynamic Bayes Nets (DBNs), allowing us to also model noisy sensors measuring aspects of the state. The DBN framework allowed us to precisely capture the fact that these measurements only depend on the current state, and that the states themselves are Markov, conditioned on a given action. These two modeling assumptions, coupled with reasoning in a discrete time-setting, are so universal in robotics that the particular action-state-measurement Dynamic Bayes Net from Section 3.3 describes almost all robot modeling approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the key properties of Dynamic Bayes nets is that they are easy to sample from , using ancestral sampling, which allows us to simulate what a given sequence of actions might accomplish, and what we would measure in these hypothetical roll-outs. This is used to illustrate or even power various perception and planning algorithms, which we discuss below."

    "## Reasoning\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayes nets are great for *modeling*, and in Section 3.4 we introduced Hidden Markov Models that allow us to reason about a sequence of hidden states, observed via noisy measurements. Hidden Markov models have been around for a long time and transformed areas such as speech recognition, and are exactly what we need for robot localization over time as well. Beyond the simple vacuum cleaning robot example, it generalizes to any robot/environment combo that we can model using discrete states transitioning over time. In our example we use just a single discrete sensor, but the HMM accommodates multiple sensors, even continuous ones. \n",
    "\n",
    "We then discussed efficient inference using factor graphs. Naive inference, be it maximum a posteriori (MAP) or computing the full posterior over the hidden states is exponential in complexity. Hence, we introduced a new graphical formalism, **factor graphs**, that focus only on the hidden variables, capturing the effect of priors, transitions, and measurements - assumed given - as **factors**. \n",
    "We showed how an HMM can easily be converted to a factor graph, but this generalizes really to any dynamic Bayes net with given actions and measurements. We then sketched out - for an HMM - the max-product and sum-product algorithms, which respectively compute the MAP estimate and the full posterior, with time complexity *linear* in the number of time steps. Such is the power if dynamic programming."

    "In Section 3.5 we then introduced Markov Decision Processes or MDPs, which we used to model decision making in a stochastic environment, albeit with complete knowledge of the state. It is a rich subject, and we introduced many new concept, including reward, utility functions, rollouts, and policies and their value. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we left learning optimal policies for last, in Section 3.6. After deriving the Bellman equation we discussed two algorithms to compute the optimal policy/value function: policy iteration and value iteration. However, both of these assume full knowledged of the world model (transition probabilities between states) and reward structure. In a model-based method we try to estimate these from experience gather by exploring the environment. However, a more direct method focused on estimating the action values (Q-values) is Q-learning, which is an example of a model-free method. Finally, we discussed how to balance exploitation and exploration to avoid getting stuck in local corners of the policy space."

    "## Background and History\n",
    "\n",
    "Markov chains date back to -you guessed it- [Andrey Markov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrey_Markov) who used them to study, among other things, the statistics of language. In fact, attesting to the importance and generality of the concept, any finite-context large language model can be viewed as a Markov chain - admittedly with a rather vast state space.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dynamic programming algorithms we introduced for HMMs are  actually special cases for linear, chain-structured factor graphs. In the HMM literature, they are known as the Viterbi and Forward-Backward algorithms, respectively. However, because at every step, one variable is eliminated from the maximization, both max-product and sum-product algorithms are in fact instances of the **elimination algorithm**, which works for *arbitrary* factor graphs, albeit not necessarily in $O(n)$ time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this book, we use factor graphs as the organizing structure for probabilistic\n",
    "inference. In later chapters we will expand their use to continuous\n",
    "variables, and will see that factor graphs aptly describe the\n",
    "independence assumptions and sparse nature of the large nonlinear\n",
    "least-squares problems arising in robotics. But their usefulness extends\n",
