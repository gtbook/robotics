    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Markov Decision Processes or MDPs can be used to model decision making in a stochastic environment, albeit with complete knowledge of the state. It is a rich subject, and we introduced many new concepts in this section:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The reward function, $R : {\\cal X} \\times {\\cal A} \\times {\\cal X} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$.\n",
    "- The expected reward, $\\bar{R}(x,a)$ for executing action $a$ in state $x$, and a corresponding greedy planning algorithm.\n",
    "- The utility function, $U: {\\cal A}^n \\times {\\cal X}^{n+1} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$, as the sum of discounted rewards.\n",
    "- The notion of rollouts to approximate the expected utility of actions.\n",
    "- The policy $\\pi: {\\cal X} \\rightarrow {\\cal A}$, as a mapping from states to actions.\n",
    "- The value function, $V^\\pi:{\\cal X} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$, associated with a given policy $\\pi$.\n",
    "- The use of policy rollouts to approximate the value function $V^\\pi$.\n",
    "- Exact calculation of the value function for a fixed policy.\n",
    "- The optimal policy and value function, governed by the Bellman equation.\n",
    "- Two algorithms to compute those: policy iteration and value iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two important extensions to MDPs that are not covered in this section:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Partially Observable MDPs (or POMDPS) are appropriate when we cannot directly observe the state.\n",
    "- Reinforcement learning, a way to learn MDP policies from *data*. This will be covered next. "
