    "Markov Decision Processes or MDPs can be used to model decision making in a stochastic environment, albeit with complete knowledge of the state. It is a rich subject, and we introduced many new concepts in this section:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The reward function, $R : {\\cal X} \\times {\\cal A} \\times {\\cal X} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$.\n",
    "- The expected reward, $\\bar{R}(x,a)$ for executing action $a$ in state $x$, and a corresponding greedy planning algorithm.\n",
    "- The utility function, $U: {\\cal A}^n \\times {\\cal X}^{n+1} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$, as the sum of discounted rewards.\n",
    "- The notion of rollouts to approximate the expected utility of actions.\n",
    "- The policy $\\pi: {\\cal X} \\rightarrow {\\cal A}$, as a mapping from states to actions.\n",
    "- The value function, $V^\\pi:{\\cal X} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$, associated with a given policy $\\pi$.\n",
    "- The use of policy rollouts to approximate the value function $V^\\pi$.\n",
    "- Exact calculation of the value function for a fixed policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll leave the concepts of an optimal policy and how to compute it for the next section. There are two other extensions to MDPs that we did not cover:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Partially Observable MDPs (or POMDPS) are appropriate when we cannot directly observe the state.\n",
    "- Reinforcement learning, a way to learn MDP policies from *data*. This will be covered in the next section as well."
