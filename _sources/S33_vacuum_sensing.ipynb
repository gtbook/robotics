In perception, the game is to estimate the state given what was measured, but the ideas we discussed before will not apply directly. For example, recall the maximum likelihood method from the previous chapter, which we could try to apply here. In our case, given a sensor reading of, say, $Z_1$=`medium`, the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) for the state $X_1$ of the robot is `dining room`: it corresponds to the highest value in the `medium` column.
