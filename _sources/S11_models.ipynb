    "To reason about the world and how to act in the world, a robot requires representations of itself, the world that it inhabits, the actions it can perform, how these affect the world, and the sensors at its disposal. In robotics, we refer to these representations as *models*, and designing appropriate, effective models is an important part of designing any robotic system.  For a specific system, the system designer must decide what to represent, and which representational schemes will be most useful. "

These representations vary from small, simple, and discrete, to large, complex, and continuous. For example, the vacuum cleaning robot in Chapter 3 models the environment as a collection of rooms and hallways connected by doors, while the logistics robot in Chapter 4 models the warehouse floor as a large, discrete grid, and the drone of Chapter 7 uses a continuous representation for position and orientation of the drone; these representations vary from a small qualitative graph to a dense grid-approximation, to a continuous, six degree-of-freedom model. \n",

At the other extreme, computer vision, which is introduced in Chapter 5, provides a dense and rich set of data."

    "High-level, symbolic representations are appropriate when low-level controllers are available to reliably execute specific tasks. This is the case for the trash collecting robot in Chapter 2 and the vacuum cleaning robot in Chapter 3. For each of these, we assume that the robot is able to execute primitive tasks (placing an object in a designated trash bin, cleaning the floor in the current room, moving through a doorway).  For these situations, high-level representations allow the robot to build high-level plans, sometimes called *task plans*, that will be executed using low-level controllers. For example, if the trash sorting robot knows that an object in its workspace is a bottle, it can invoke the primitive action of moving the object to the glass bin, and if the vacuum cleaning robot knows that the living room is adjacent to the kitchen, it can move directly from the living room to the kitchen using the appropriate motion primitive."

    "While high-level, qualitative state descriptions may be useful for task-level planning, because they fail to capture any of the geometric aspects of the environment, they are less useful when the robot begins to actually move in, and interact with, the world. For example, cleaning the floor in a room is actually a fairly complex action, and, other than in textbooks, is unlikely to be directly encoded as a primitive action in a robot system.  For mobile robots, such as the logistics robot of Chapter 4, it is often sufficient to use a discrete grid to represent which parts of the environment contain objects (or obstacles), and thus cannot be traversed by the robot. Occupancy grids, in which the presence or absence of an obstacle is noted for each cell (perhaps probabilistically), are a popular representation for this situation. \n"

    "In some cases, a more precise geometric description of the world state may be required.  Consider the case of an autonomous car, as in Chapter 6, driving in an environment populated with other cars, cyclists, and pedestrians. When objects in the environment are moving, occupancy grids are not an effective representation (e.g., the grid would need to be continuously updated as objects move in the world). In this case, we might choose to associate a specific position and orientation with each object in the environment, and to update these as the object moves. There are several ways to represent this kind of geometric information, but the most common is to define a Cartesian coordinate frame that is rigidly attached to the object (i.e., the relationship between the object and this coordinate frame is fixed, and does not change as the object moves), and to then specify the position and orientation of this coordinate frame relative to a reference frame (possibly the robot’s own coordinate frame, possibly a fixed external reference frame).  In Chapters 4 and 5, we will see how stereo computer vision and LIDAR can be used to determine this information for objects in the world."

Furthermore, the robot has direct control over its own actions, unlike obstacles or other actors in the world, over which the robot has, at best, indirect control. Therefore, rather than merely incorporate information about the robot into the world state, we typically represent the robot state separately, using representations that are specifically developed for modeling the robot’s geometry, dynamics, and manipulation capabilities.\n",

We do the same for the robot (assuming the robot can be modeled as a single rigid body), and we call this frame the *body frame* or the *body-attached frame*.  Now, as for objects, specifying the location of the robot is equivalent to specifying the position and orientation of the body-attached frame, and such a specification defines a configuration for the robot. For example, we can define the configuration of a DDR using the coordinates $q = (x, y, \\theta)$, which specify the location of the origin of the body-attached frame along with its orientation relative to a fixed reference frame.\n",

If we wish instead to describe the motion of a robot, we must consider the configuration to be time varying, and in this case both the configuration and its time derivative (a velocity) are relevant. We often package the configuration and its time derivative into a single vector\n",

Note that $\\omega$ is not actually the time derivative of any relevant quantity describing the robot’s motion, but is instead a parameterization of the derivative of a rotation matrix. We will use 3D rotation matrices, their derivatives, and angular velocity in Chapter 7, to describe the motion of drones.\n",

    "In many applications, position and velocity provide a sufficiently detailed description of robot motion. This is not true, however, when we must explicitly consider forces that affect the robot’s motion, as with the drone, whose motion is determined by aerodynamic forces.  For example, we can regard the logistics robot as a device that responds to position and velocity commands: we issue a command to the robot to move to a certain position at a certain velocity, and the robot has no difficulty in executing this command (though there may be uncertainty associated to the motion). There are, however, numerous applications in which simple geometric descriptions of robot motion are not adequate. Consider for example the case of a quadrotor that maneuvers by exploiting aerodynamic forces. In these cases, we typically consider position, velocity, and acceleration, i.e., in terms of $x$ and $\\dot{x}$, or, if making the configuration and its derivatives more explicit, in terms of $q, \\dot{q},$ and $\\ddot{q}$."

In particular, by modeling the affects of actions on the world and on the robot itself, a planning system can construct a sequence of actions to achieve its goals.  Action models are intimately connected to state models. Since actions change the state of the world and the robot, the choice of state model determines the vocabulary for the action models. As such, action models tend to mirror the abstraction level chosen for the state.\n",

    "For high-level state models, such as the trash sorting robot or vacuum cleaning robot, the actions are also defined at a high level. For the trash sorting robot, we will merely assume that actions exist to transfer an object to each of three possible bins, essentially omitting all details of how the action might be implemented. For the vacuum cleaning robot, actions take the form of directed edges in a place graph, in which the vertices represent rooms. As we will see in Chapter 3, if, for example, the robot state is *living room*, the action “move right” corresponds to changing the state to *kitchen* (though, when uncertainty comes into play, other outcomes are also possible). In the absence of uncertainty, the action acts as a deterministic mapping from the current state to a next state. For the vacuuming robot, the state space is merely the set of rooms, and one action exists for each possible transit from one room to another.\n"
