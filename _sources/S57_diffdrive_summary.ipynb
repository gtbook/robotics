    "computer vision or path planning for mobile robots.\n",
    "A motion planning system that only avoids collision *on average* is not acceptable in many applications.\n",

    "spectacularly and catastrophically when used to guide robots operating in the real world,\n",
    "such as for self-driving cars (which we will see in Chapter 6).\n",
    "\n",
    "Computer vision involves reasoning about images, and images are collections of pixels,\n",
    "therefore, the first computer vision algorithms that we described were simple\n",
    "image processing algorithms that operated on collections of pixels in an input image\n",
    "to produce and output image.\n",
    "Many of these image processing algorithms were merely variations on\n",
    "convolution (e.g., smoothing, edge detection)\n",

    "However, the real power of deep nets is that they can be used trained to implement operations\n",
    "that are not well understood, and that have not been successfully implemented using traditional\n",
    "computer algorithms.\n",
    "The secret to this power is that it is possible to *learn* the parameters of the network!\n",

    "In previous chapters, we framed the planning problem in terms of maximizing an expected reward function.\n",
    "In this chapter, we looked at a more specific problem: planning a collision-free path for the robot\n",
    "from its initial configuration to a specified goal configuration.\n",
    "We began by showing how this problem could be solved by using a special case of value iteration\n",
    "(no stochastic component, negative reward for collision, high reward for reaching the goal),\n",

    "Path planners that use artificial potential fields attempt to achieve this by constructing a function that behaves similarly\n",

    "thus eliminating the computational cost of dynamic programming.\n",
    "These algorithms work by evaluating the gradient of the potential function at the current configuration,\n",
    "and using gradient descent to make progress toward the goal, essentially focusing attention on computing\n",
    "the potential function along a single path to the goal, rather than computing a global representation of the value function.\n",
    "The problem with these methods is that the potential functions are almost never equivalent to the value function.\n",
    "In particular, the value function has a single optimum at the goal,\n",
    "while an artificial potential function typically has many local minima, which will trap gradient descent methods.\n",

    "and then use fast and efficient motion planning algorithms to find local paths\n",
    "between these samples.\n",
    "In order for these methods to be effective, two conditions must hold:\n",
    "the random selection of configurations should ensure good coverage of the entire configuration\n",
    "space (as the number of samples increases), and the local path planning problems should be easy to solve\n",
    "(typically this is the case when the distance between two configurations is small).\n",
    "\n",
    "Probabilistic road maps (PRMs) are graphs whose vertices correspond to sample configurations,\n",
    "and whose edges correspond to local paths between sample configurations.\n",
    "They are constructed by iteratively generating random samples and connecting each new sample\n",
    "to nearby samples that are already represented in the graph. This is an offline process, intended to build an\n",
    "approximate, global representation of the free configuration space.\n",
    "Equipped with a PRM, path planning is reduced to (a) finding a path from the initial configuration to some\n",
    "vertex in the graph, (b) finding a path from the goal configuration to a vertex in the graph, and (c) searching\n",
    "the graph for a path that connects these two vertices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rapidly-Exploring Random Trees (RRTs) are constructed by iteratively adding vertices to a tree whose root\n",
    "corresponds to the initial configuration, until a leaf is added that can be easily connected to the goal configuration.\n",
    "The trick that makes RRTs work is that the randomly generated samples are not themselves\n",
    "added to the tree; instead, they are used to determine which vertex in the existing tree should be expanded.\n",
    "Specifically, the vertex $q_\\mathrm{near}$ in the existing tree that is nearest to the\n",
    "randomly generated configuration $q_\\mathrm{rand}$ is selected for expansion,\n",
    "and the expansion is achieved by constructing a local path from $q_\\mathrm{near}$ in the\n",
    "direction of $q_\\mathrm{rand}$, terminating at the configuration $q_\\mathrm{new}$, which is added to the tree.\n",
    "If $q_\\mathrm{rand}$ is generated by sampling from a uniform distribution, the RRT will tend to explore\n",
    "the entire configuration space, ensuring (in an asymptotic, probabilistic sense) that a path will be found\n",
    "if one exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, it is worth noting that, apart from value iteration, all of the planning methods introduced \n",
    "in this chapter can be considered as sampling-based algorithms for path planning.\n",
    "For the case of PRMs and RRTs, the samples are randomly generated, while for potential fields methods,\n",
    "we can consider each step in the gradient descent algorithm as a sample along the path\n",
    "currently under exploration.\n",
    "While the sampling strategies for these two approaches (random generation vs. gradient descent) are quite\n",
    "different, both share the property that paths are constructed by generating sample configurations and building\n",
    "a graph (a general graph for PRMs, a tree for RRTs, and a simple linear graph for potential fields).\n",
    "The resulting graphs essentially represent one-dimensional subsets of the configuration space,\n",
    "and the goal is to construct these sets so that their connectivity matches the connectivity of\n",
    "the free configuration space with respect to the problem at hand."
