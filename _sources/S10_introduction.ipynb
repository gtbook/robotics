    "Robotics is a fascinating, and broadly interdisciplinary field,\n",
    "combining aspects of engineering, computer science, mathematics, physics, and even psychology.\n",
    "Moreover, society now finds itself at the dawn of a new, golden age of robotics,\n",
    "as robots are increasingly moving out of highly regulated factory environments into\n",
    "commercial settings, hospitals, our homes, our streets, and even the skies.\n",
    "How do these systems work? What sensors do they have and how do they perceive our world through these senses?\n",
    "What are the mechanisms by which they can move and act in their environment, and how do they choose their actions at any given moment?\n",
    "How can they learn to adapt their behavior over time to improve their capabilities and enhance interactions with humans they encounter?\n",
    "These questions frame an incredibly broad and rich subject, and given the recent advances in artificial intelligence,\n",
    "the field of robotics is bound to see many breakthroughs over the next few years.\n",
    "\n",
    "This introductory text is designed to guide the reader through the *foundations* of modern robotics,\n",
    "while at the same time showing how practical systems can be implemented.\n",
    "The theoretical concepts in each chapter are explained informally without sacrificing rigor,\n",
    "balanced with a unique hands-on approach. Theory is immediately put into practice,\n",
    "as every section in the book is interspersed with example code and can be executed as a python notebook,\n",
    "allowing the reader to experiment with implementations that are representative of many robotics systems.\n",
    "No experience is needed beyond a good basis in math, especially linear algebra and notions of statistics,\n",
    "and some knowledge of the python programming language.\n",
    "The code itself is based on popular open source libraries, most notably GTSAM and PyTorch,\n",
    "which provide a good starting point for those who want to explore robotics as a potential career choice."

    "The sense-think-act cycle is a recurring theme in this book.\n",
    "While the range of applications for modern robotic systems is quite diverse, at a high level, most all systems take the same approach.\n",
    "They use sensors and perception algorithms to assess their environment; they reason about their goals and how to achieve them; they perform actions to change the state of the world.\n",
    "This is known as the **sense-think-act** cycle.\n",
    "The robot senses its world, thinks about what to do, then acts.\n",
    "This idea is general enough to be applied at many levels of abstraction and time scales.\n",
    "We can imagine a warehouse robot tasked with retrieving an item from inventory. After using its sensors to determine its current location (sense),\n",
    "the robot constructs a path (think), then traverses the path (act).\n",
    "The time scale here might be on the order of seconds to minutes to complete one iteration of the sense-think-act cycle,\n",
    "and the level of abstraction is very high, ignoring details like controlling motors.\n",
    "On the other hand, we could consider a surgical robot tasked with precisely inserting a needle into a tumor.\n",
    "In this case, ultrasonic sensors could be used to localize the needle relative to the tumor (sense),\n",
    "small corrections to needle placement would be computed (think),\n",
    "and a low-level motion command would be sent to the device, possibly a voltage or current, to effect the motion (act).\n",
    "Here, the time scale is on the order of milliseconds, and the level of abstraction could be quite detailed,\n",
    "including tissue dynamics and flexibility of the needle."
