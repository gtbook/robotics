    "\n",
    "> For a trash sorting robot, the destination bin is the most important aspect of an action.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our trash sorting robot, we will define four actions, each of which can be executed when\n",
    "there is an item of trash in the work space (i.e., there are no preconditions for the actions).\n",
    "The first three actions use the robot manipulator to move an item of trash\n",
    "to one of three bins: glass, metal, or mixed paper.\n",
    "The fourth action is a nop,\n",
    "which corresponds to the robot simply allowing the item to\n",
    "pass through the work space, to be processed, for example, by a human worker\n",
    "(note that \"nop\" is a shorthand used in many programming languages\n",
    "to denote \"no operation\").\n",
    "\n",
    "We assign labels to these actions as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $a_1$: put in glass bin\n",
    "* $a_2$: put in metal bin\n",
    "* $a_3$: put in mixed paper bin\n",
    "* $a_4$: nop (let the object continue, unsorted)\n",
    "\n",
    "and each of these actions can be applied at any stage of execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the robot had perfect knowledge of the world state (i.e., if the robot always knew\n",
    "exactly the category of the item in the work space), choosing an action would be simple:\n",
    "place paper and scrap cardboard in the paper bin; place cans and scrap metal in the metal bin;\n",
    "place bottles in the glass bin. The nop action would never be used.\n",
    "But what if the robot's knowledge of the world state is uncertain?\n",
    "Suppose, for example, that it sometimes mistakes scrap metal for cardboard.\n",
    "Placing scrap metal in the paper bin could lead to significant damage to\n",
    "trash processing equipment, possibly requiring the facility to shut down completely\n",
    "while repairs are made.\n",
    "In contrast, if the robot places paper into the metal bin, serious damage is unlikely, and the cost of this wrong decision would likely be much smaller.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to make informed decisions about which action to take,\n",
    "the robot needs to have some quantitative way to evaluate the cost of\n",
    "executing the wrong actions.\n",
    "This begins by assigning a cost to each action, depending on the world\n",
    "state when the action is executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this example, we will assign zero cost when the robot executes the correct action,\n",
    "and positive value costs when wrong actions are executed, depending on the severity\n",

    "The modern, axiomatic approach to probability theory begins with three axioms, from which\n",
    "all other properties are derived:\n",

    " Probability theory does not consider the problem of how one might obtain the probability distribution $P$.\n",

    "In ths section we considered the foundational concept of robot *actions*, focusing on how robot systems can use actions to intervene in the physical world. For our very abstracted world state, we considered discrete, symbolic actions, and introduced probability theory to model the uncertain outcomes associated with each action. We introduced the notion of *expectation* to think about the average outcome of actions over time. And, we ended by contrasting probability theory with statistics, and how the weak law of large numbers bridges the gap between these two formalisms."
