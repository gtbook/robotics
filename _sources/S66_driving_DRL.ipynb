    "Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) applies the power of deep learning to bring reinforcement learning to much more complex domains than what we were able to tackle with the Markov Decision Processes and RL concepts introduced in Chapter 3. The use of large, expressive neural networks has allowed researchers and practitioners alike to work with high bandwidth sensors such as video streams and LIDAR, and bring the promise of RL into real-world domains such as autonomous driving. This is still a field of active discovery and research, however, and we can give but a brief introduction here about what is a vast literature and problem space."

    "A simple example in the autonomous driving domain is *lane switching*. Suppose we are driving along at 3-lane highway, and we can see some ways ahead, and some ways behind us. We are driving at a speed that is comfortable to us, but other cars have different ideas about the optimal speed to drive at. Hence, sometimes we would like to change lanes, and we could learn a policy to do this for us. As discussed in Section 6.5, this is **lateral control**. A more sophisticated example would also allow us to adapt our speed to the traffic pattern, but by relying on a smart cruise control system we could safely ignore the **longitudinal control** problem."

    "To turn this into a reinforcement learning problem, we first need to define a state space ${\\cal X}$ and an action space ${\\cal A}$. There are a variety of ways to engineer this aspect of the problem. For example, we could somehow encode the longitudinal distance and lane index for each of the K closest cars, where K is a parameter, say 5 or 10. One problem is that the number of cars that are *actually* present is variable, which is difficult to deal with. Another approach is to make this into an image processing problem, by creating a finite element representation of the road before and behind us, and marking each cell as occupied or not. The latter is fairly compatible with automotive sensors such as LIDAR."
