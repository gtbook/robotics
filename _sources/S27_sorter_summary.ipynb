    "In this chapter, we used probability to reason about the uncertain category of an object in the robot's work space.\n",
    "We began by introducing *probability distributions*, which assign probability values to *events* (i.e., to subsets of the set of all possible outcomes). In the case of discrete outcomes, such as our five categories\n",
    "of trash, these probability distributions are called *probability mass functions* or *PMFs*, and they assign finite probability to each possible category.\n",
    "When the set of outcomes is continuous, such as the scale we used to measure an object's weight,\n",
    "these probability distributions are called *probability density functions* or *pdf's*, and they assign probability values to subsets of real numbers, for example, to intervals of the form $[a,b]$,\n",
    "and this probabilty value can be computed by integrating the pdf over the interval.\n",
    "Interestingly, for the continuous case, zero probability is assigned to any individual outcome,\n",
    "since this would correspond to an interval of the form $[a,a]$, and for any continuous\n",
    "function $f$, we have $\\int_a^a f(u)du = 0$."

    "## Background and History\n",
    "The origins of probability theory can be traced back to games of chance in ancient societies, but the first real attempts to formalize the study of probability came during the Renaissance, in the works of mathematicians such as Cardano, Pascal, and Fermat. These early mathematical approaches still focused mainly on games of chance, with a strong empirical flavor. The line between statistics and probability theory was a blurry one in Renaissance times.\n",
    "What we think of today as probability theory was formalized in the early 1930â€™s by Kolmogorov. It was Kolmogorov who formulated the three axioms that form the basis for modern probability theory:\n",
    "1.\tFor any event $A$, $P(A) \\geq 0$.\n",
    "2.\t$P(\\Omega)=1$.\n",
    "3.\tFor disjoint events $A$ and $B$, $P(A\\cup B) = P(A) + P(B)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Equipped with these three axioms and a background in *real analysis*, one can derive most all of the important results that comprise modern probability theory.\n",
    "The Renaissance mathematicians were interested in understanding random phenomena. Kolmogorov, a Russian mathematician, was interested in establishing a rigorous theoretical foundation for probability theory. It was Bayes who pioneered the idea of using evidence, together with ideas from probability theory, to draw inferences. \n",
