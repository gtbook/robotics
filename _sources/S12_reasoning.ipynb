    "Reasoning involves manipulating data and models, ultimately reaching conclusions. This can take the form of perception, in which sensor data and models are used to make inferences about the state of the world or the robot; planning, in which action models and the perceived state are used to infer a plan that can transform the state of the world or the robot from its current state to a desired state; and, learning, in which data and models are used to improve the robot’s performance over time. In this book, reasoning ranges from very simple mathematical manipulations of probabilities to learning millions of parameters for a deep neural network."

    "> Perception uses sensor data to drive inference about the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sensors are characterized by observation models that map the state of the world to\n",
    "sensor values.  These models are sometimes called *forward models*.\n",
    "For a given state of the world, one can use geometry and physics to uniquely determine (modulo uncertainty) the sensor output.  Perception is concerned with the *inverse* problem:\n",
    "Given a set of sensor measurements, infer something about the state of the world.\n",
    "Inverse problems are notoriously difficult, in part because they are often ill-defined.\n",
    "For example, in the noiseless case, if a range sensor is 10 meters from wall,\n",
    "we can easily predict that the sensor will return $h(x) = z = 10$. \n",
    "The inverse problem is to determine something about the state of the world, \n",
    "given that the sensor measurement is $z = 10$.  This is an ill-defined problem, since there are many possible world states that could lead to a measurement of $z=10$.\n",
    "The robot might be $10$ meters from a wall, or perhaps another robot has crossed $10$ meters in front of the sensor, or perhaps an open door $10$ meters in front of the robot has just been closed.\n",
    "Perception is concerned with these inverse problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the presence of uncertainty, things become even more difficult. It is easy to illustrate the difficulty with a simple medical example. If you have the flu, there is a very high probability that you will have a fever.\n",
    "But if you have a fever, what is the probability that you have the flu? The latter question is complicated by the fact that there are many possible causes for a fever. Medical doctors use the presence of fever, along with other evidence (sore throat? cough? burning eyes?), combined with contextual knowledge (is it flu season? has there been an outbreak of flu in the past days?) to make a diagnosis. In other words, they perform inference by fusing multiple sources of evidence, and considering the context for the evidence. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this book we consider two main approaches to perception: approaches based on probability theory, and approaches that apply machine learning tools such as deep neural networks. In each case, tools from optimization are often used. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first part of the book focuses mainly on probabilistic approaches. For example, the trash sorting robot in Chapter 2 uses a maximum likelihood approach to recognize categories of recycling material. This approach essentially optimizes the value of a conditional probability function that models sensors. In Chapter 4, probabilistic models of actions and sensors are combined to estimate a probability distribution for the robot’s current state. In Chapter 6, optimization over probabilistic models is used to simultaneously construct a map and localize the robot within the map (the SLAM problem).  In each of these cases, the reasoning and models are explicit.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also describe how neural networks can be used to solve perception problems. Neural networks do not use explicit models. Instead, their reasoning process is essentially encoded as a set of weights on the connections in the network. Choosing the values for these weights is typically a large-scale optimization problem that is driven by available data. \n",
    "In a sense, neural networks learn a solution to inverse probles. In Chapter 5, we introduce neural networks for computer vision problems, and in Chapter 7 we extend these ideas to neural radiance fields (NeRF)."

    "##    Planning\n",
    "> Planning is the process of determining which actions to execute in order to effect desired changes in the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "Planning can mean very different things, depending on the complexity of the task, the time scale for actions,\n",
    "the uncertainty involved, and the complexity of the robot.\n",
    "For simple tasks that can be characterized at a fairly high level of abstraction, symbolic descriptions can be used, and planning can often be reduced to either a decision-theoretic problem, or to a graph search problem. This is the case for both the trash sorting robot and the vacuum cleaning robot.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the trash sorting robot, planning reduces to making individual decisions about which bin is appropriate for a piece of trash. For the vacuum cleaning robot, planning takes the form of constructing an optimal policy: Given a specific goal location, determine the optimal action to apply for each possible robot state, such that the robot makes its way to the goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we move down the abstraction hierarchy, from high-level task planning to low-level control, planning requires increasing computation, and begins to take into consideration both the geometry and the physics of the problem at hand. For example, when the dynamics of the task are important (as is the case for drones in Chapter 7), planning must consider the dynamic equations of the system.\n",
    "If uncertainty is involved, it is impossible to provide deterministic performance guarantees,\n",

    "### Path Planning\n",
    "\n",
    "Path planning deals with the problem of moving the robot from one position to another.  Avoiding collisions with obstacles in the environment (including humans and other robots) is generally a central concern for path planners.\n",
    "\n",
    "An easy way to address this problem is to discretize the world into a grid and then label grid cells as either being free or as containing an obstacle. The path planning problem is then to find a sequence of free grid cells such that the initial robot position is contained in the starting cell and the goal position is contained in the final cell. The disadvantage to this approach is that the representation of free space is conservative.  If a cell is partially blocked by an obstacle, then the entire cell will be treated as an obstacle and therefore be unavailable to the robot; there may be cases for which a collision-free path exists in the world, but not in the grid. In such cases, the robot will be unable to find a free path, even though it exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "For many tasks, grid-based approximations are not sufficiently accurate. Furthermore, the size of the required grid grows exponentially with the number of degrees of freedom for the system.\n",
    "A robot that moves in the plane might use a $100 \\times 100$ grid to represent the position of the robot. If we decide to consider also the orientation of the robot, also using $100$ discretization levels, the grid grows to $100 \\times 100 \\times 100$.  If we consider a drone and represent its 3D position and 3D orientation, the grid grows to $100^6$, a very large data structure, for a fairly coarse quantization of the drone’s configuration space.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the problem of planning a collision-free path for a robot that can move in arbitrary directions, there exist exact algorithms that are guaranteed to find a solution when one exists, or to terminate in finite time when no solution exists (these algorithms are called *complete* algorithms). Unfortunately, even the fastest of these algorithms has computational complexity that increases exponentially with the number of degrees of freedom of the robot (in addition to being extremely difficult to implement). For this reason, much research in path planning has focused on computationally efficient algorithms that perform well in practice, even though deterministic performance guarantees are not available.  Randomized, sampling-based algorithms are the most popular of these, and we will see some of these in Chapter 5, to plan paths for our DDR."

    "While path planning considers the \"shape\" of the path from start to goal (e.g., consider the smoke trail that would be left by a sky-writing drone), trajectory planning also considers the time parameterization of that path (how fast the drone traverses the path). \n",
    "\n",
    "In this book, dynamic effects become important in Chapter 7, where we consider a drone robot. Aerodynamics can be computationally difficult; to achieve ultimate accuracy requires solving systems of partial differential equations. Therefore, we will use numerical approximations for the aerodynamic effects and solve a trajectory optimization problem that considers performance criteria that include obstacle avoidance, start and goal states (i.e., boundary value specification), and smoothness (e.g., bounding velocity and acceleration). For completeness, we also introduce a control scheme that can execute the final trajectory on an actual drone."
