    "It is often the case that robots do not have access to a complete and correct model of the environment. If sensors are used to determine the world state, there will invariably be errors and uncertainties associated to the sensor measurements. For example, the trash sorting robot has several sensors, all of which report data that is corrupted by noise, and these measurements are therefore subject to multiple possible interpretations. Furthermore, the effects of the robot’s own actions might be uncertain, as is the case with our vacuum cleaning robot, which sometimes fails to arrive at its desired destination, or with the logistics robot, whose motion is affected by factors such as variable friction of the factory floor and variation in motor performance. \n",

The concept of *expectation* quantifies what we would expect to see *on average* after many trials or many observations. For example, if we command the logistics robot to move forward by one meter and repeat this many times, what would be the average distance moved by the robot at each step. \n",

There are many related theorems (sometimes called *limit theorems*), but they generally share the same insight:  as the size of a data set becomes large, the statistics of that data set will become increasingly good approximations for various properties of the underlying probability distribution from which the data set was generated.

We will encounter a very convenient algorithm, ancestral sampling, that can be applied to sample from any Bayesian network with ease. For example, when studying reinforcement learning in Chapter 3, we will generate sample trajectories for our logistics robot using ancestral sampling. We can use these sample trajectories to compute the expected performance over a future time horizon. For example, to evaluate the quality of a candidate control policy, we can generate a large number of sample paths (or rollouts), and compute the average cost (or reward) over these trajectories. This provides an approximation of the *value function* for the policy, a key concept in reinforcement learning measuring how much reward can be expected to be gained starting from a given state."

This property leads to an efficient implementation of an algorithm called *policy iteration* that (a) uses the current estimate of the optimal value function to update a guess for the optimal policy, (b) computes the exact value function for this improved policy by solving a system of linear equations, and (c) iterates by using this new value function as the new guess for the optimal value function.

Unsurprisingly, complex densities over many continuous variables can be represented using Gaussian Bayes nets and/or Gaussian factor graphs, which then allow for very efficient manipulation through libraries such as GTSAM.

Happily, by using sensor measurements, it is possible to reduce uncertainty.  A number of questions immediately come to mind. How do we mathematically model the propagation of uncertainty? How do we quantify the reduction in uncertainty that can be achieved using sensor data? What is the optimal way to combine predictions (using models of actions and the associated uncertainty) and observations (from sensor data) to update estimates of the robot’s state? The answers to these questions lead to the development of the well-known Kalman Filter, which we will introduce in Chapter 4. It turns out that the answer to each of these questions is formulated using linear algebra."

The *instantaneous* relationship between the angular velocities of the two wheels and the linear and angular velocities of the robot is linear! The matrix that encodes this relationship is called a *Jacobian* matrix (which may include time-varying entries that are nonlinear functions of configuration variables). You may remember Jacobian matrices from an advanced calculus class. If so, you may recall that the Jacobian of a function relates the derivatives of the function’s input to the derivatives of its output.  Even for highly nonlinear functions, the instantaneous relationship between these derivatives is linear, and expressed by the Jacobian matrix.

In this case, there are typically well-defined relationships between each $x_k$ and $x_{k+1}$. This is true, for example, when a robot moves through the world, at each step $k$ executing command $u_k$ and collecting data $z_k$.  Estimating the state trajectory $x_1, \\dots, x_n$ can be formulated as an optimization problem in which the value of $u_k$ acts as a kind of constraint on the relationship between $x_k$ and $x_{k+1}$, as we will see in Chapter 4 when we solve the localization problem.  Similarly, if we wish to optimize the trajectory of a drone (as in Chapter 7), the optimization problem begins by finding a sequence of states $x_1, \\dots, x_n$ that maximize performance criteria. In this case, in order to ensure smooth flight, $x_k$ and $x_{k+1}$ should not be too far apart.
