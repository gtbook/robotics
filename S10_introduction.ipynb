    "This introductory text is designed to guide the reader through the *foundations* of modern robotics, while at the same time showing how practical systems can be implemented. The theoretical concepts in each chapter are explained informally without sacrificing rigor, balanced with a unique hands-on approach. Theory is immediately put into practice, as every section in the book is interspersed with example code and can be executed as a python notebook, allowing the reader to experiment with implementations that are representative of many robotics systems. No experience is needed beyond a good basis in math, especially linear algebra and notions of statistics, and some knowledge of the python programming language. The code itself is based on popular open source libraries, most notably GTSAM and PyTorch, which provide a good starting point for those who want to explore robotics as a potential career choice."

    "While the range of applications for modern robotic systems is quite diverse, at a high level, most all systems take the same approach.\n",
    "They use sensors and perception algorithms to assess their environment; they reason about their goals and how to achieve them;  they perform actions to change the state of the world.\n",
    "This is known as the **sense-think-act** cycle.\n",
    "The robot senses its world, thinks about what to do, then acts.\n",
    "This idea is general enough to be applied at many levels of abstraction and time scales.\n",
    "We can imagine a warehouse robot tasked with retrieving an item from inventory. After using its sensors to determine its current location (sense),\n",
    "the robot constructs a path (think), then traverses the path (act). The time scale here might be on the order of seconds to minutes to complete one iteration of the sense-think-act loop, and the level of abstraction is very high, ignoring details like controlling motors.\n",
    "On the other hand, we could consider a surgical robot tasked with precisely inserting a needle into a tumor. In this case, ultrasonic sensors could be used to localize the needle relative to the tumor (sense), small corrections to needle placement would be computed (think), and a low-level motion command would be sent to the device, possibly a voltage or current, to effect the motion (act). Here, the time scale is on the order of milliseconds, and the level of abstraction could be quite detailed, including tissue dynamics and flexibility of the needle.\n",
    "The sense-think-act cycle is a recurring theme in this book."

    " We begin, in Chapter 2, by considering a simple trash sorting robot. Pieces of trash arrive on a conveyor, and the robot’s task is to place these in an appropriate bin. For this first robotic system, we abstract away most all details that would confront a real trash sorting robot, focusing our attention on fundamental concepts from probability theory, both to solve a simple perception problem (categorizing pieces of trash) and to solve a planning problem (which bin to select). From there, in each chapter we incrementally add complexity to the system models and the mathematical methods for manipulating them, developing increasingly sophisticated algorithms to implement these methods. We consider a simple vacuum cleaning robot in Chapter 3, a mobile robot that navigates in a warehouse in Chapter 4, a two-wheeled, differential drive robot (DDR) in Chapter 5, self-driving cars in Chapter 6, and quadrotor drones in Chapter 7."

    "The individual chapters share a common structure, delving into how to represent the robot's state, how to describe its actuators and sensors, the corresponding perception and planning methods and algorithms, and ending with a section on learning from data. The expressiveness of the state space, which is tied to how much we do or do not abstract away from reality, determines to a large degree the complexity of the corresponding algorithms. By gradually building up this richness, we ensure that each chapter builds upon the previous one, guiding the reader along a series of achievable steps. Key to our approach is the use of **graphical models** to help explain how state, actions, and sensing share many commonalities across a diverse set of autonomous robots.\n",

    "In the state, action, and sensing sections of each chapter we focus on the mathematical *models*. To model robots, we move from discrete state spaces and fairly abstract action and sensing, to continuous state spaces and real-world sensing in later sections. We introduce the special Euclidean group of order two, $SE(2)$ for differential drive robots, and extend it to $SE(3)$ for the case of drones. We develop the differential kinematics for wheeled mobile robots, both for omnidirectional robots (our logistics robot), and for robots with nonholonomic constraints.  In the case of drones, we derive a model for the dynamics that includes propellor thrust and aerodynamic properties such as drag.  We take a similar approach with sensors. In Chapter 2, we introduce simple sensors that measure physical properties of a piece of trash. Then, in subsequent chapters, we consider an increasing array of sensors, including proximity sensors, RFID beacons, GPS, cameras, LIDAR, and Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs)."

We introduce discrete probability distributions for simple classification problems, and develop maximum-likelihood and maximum-a-posteriori estimation methods for these using our trash-sorting robot. We introduce continuous distributions, and specifically the uniform and Gaussian distributions, to model the motion of mobile robots and the effects of sensor noise. To reason about the effects of uncertainty, we introduce sampling-based methods, such as particle filtering and Markov localization, Kalman filters, Bayes nets, and Markov decision processes. In each case, we begin by formulating the appropriate mathematical models, and then proceed to describe algorithmic solutions (often illustrated with code).\n",
