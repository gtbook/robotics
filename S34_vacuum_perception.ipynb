The key mathematical concept that tied all this together was the language of dynamic Bayes nets. \n",

Note that the algorithmic sketch above only yields the *value* of the factor graph at the maximum. A key part of the Viterbi algorithm is adding some bookkeeping, so that after the recursion terminates, we can recover the actual variable assignments that make the factor graph attain its maximum value.\n",
    "Also, the complexity of max-product for HMMs is *linear* in the number of nodes, which is a nice improvement over exponential complexity. The complexity of every elimination step is quadratic in the number of states, because we have to form the product factors and then maximize over them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because at every step, one variable is eliminated from the maximization, the max-product algorithm is in fact an instance of the **elimination algorithm**, which works for *arbitrary* factor graphs, albeit not necessarily in $O(n)$ time. Indeed, the max-product (and sum-product below) can be applied in more general settings than the linear chains one finds in HMMs. While we won't discuss this connection in more detail here, the elimination algorithm pops up in many other contexts, and is worth a book in its own right."
